The Bloch sphere qubits show interesting dynamics:
- Qubits start with random θ initialization
- Over 60 seconds, they evolve under biome Hamiltonian influence
- Wheat icon (θ≈π/4) and mushroom icon (θ≈π) create dual attractions
- Hybrid qubits evolve toward weighted equilibria
- Energy dissipation (radius decay) is slow but visible

Key insight: Quantum evolution is DETERMINISTIC given initial conditions.
Gameplay outcome is set at planting time. Strategic choice at plant time matters.

Wheat ready when θ ≈ π/4 ≈ 0.785 rad (45°)
Current threshold: Distance < 0.4 rad (~22.9°)

Observation: Not all crops reach perfect readiness in 60 seconds.
This creates TENSION:
- Wait longer? Quantum radius might decay
- Harvest early? Get less-efficient crop, lose alignment bonus
- Measurement collapses superposition - once measured, no more evolution

Excellent gameplay: timing pressure + quantum tradeoff.

Current state:
- Starting credits: 50

CRITICAL OBSERVATION: Credits unchanged!

Current flow is: plant → measure → harvest (increment wheat_inventory)
But wheat inventory has NO VALUE.

Missing: Market conversion loop
  wheat_inventory → process (mill) → flour → SELL → credits

Dead crops. Inventory grows but has no economic tie-in.
This explains why challenge_time_trial (20 credits) is hard -
no crop-to-credit conversion means economy is cosmetic!

SOLUTION: Implement market mechanics that convert crops → credits

You're intrigued by enriching biome with 🏰,💰 or 🏰,👥

Current state: Biome has wheat/mushroom icons + sun, but no AUTHORITY.

WHAT EXISTS: economy.tributes_paid/failed - tribute system ready!
             But currently decoupled from biome.

PROPOSAL - Add Imperium Authority to Biome:

1. IMPERIUM QUBIT (new icon like wheat/mushroom)
   - Represents imperial authority/control presence
   - Stable point: θ≈π (opposite of wheat, aligned with mushroom)
   - Couples to emoji qubits: "tax gravitates toward imperium"

2. TRIBUTE AS SPATIAL GAME (leverage existing economy system)
   - Imperium qubits near plots = high tribute demand
   - Crops near Imperium: taxed, but maybe high yield?
   - Crops far from Imperium: safe but low yield

   Distance-based tax:
     tax_rate = (1.0 - distance_from_imperium) * base_tribute_rate

3. 🏰,💰 (Imperium + Gold) vs 🏰,👥 (Imperium + People)

   a) 🏰,💰 Regime: "Extractive"
      - High tribute (drain credits)
      - Crops grow faster (magical interference)
      - Stable equilibria shift toward Imperium
      - Players must manage cash despite high taxation

   b) 🏰,👥 Regime: "Feudal Labor"
      - Tribute = labor debt (workers assigned to empire)
      - Players control labor allocation
      - Imperium limits available workers
      - Strategic: grow wheat for local needs vs. empire conscription

4. IMPLEMENTATION SKETCH

   class_name ImperiumQubit extends Qubit:
       var tribute_rate: float = 0.02  # % credits/second
       var regime: String = "extractive"  # or "feudal"

   # In Biome._coupling():
   func _apply_imperium_effects():
       for emoji_qubit in all_emoji_qubits:
           var distance_to_imperium = bloch_distance(emoji_qubit, imperium_qubit)
           var tax_force = tribute_rate * (1.0 - distance_to_imperium)
           emoji_qubit.theta += tax_force  # Pull toward imperium

           economy.pay_tribute(tax_force * base_amount)

This transforms game from:
   "Plant crops and wait for evolution"
TO:
   "Farm under imperial oppression - minimize taxes while maximizing yield"

Biome becomes CONTESTED SPACE where:
   - Quantum forces evolve crops toward natural equilibria
   - Imperial power extracts tribute and controls territory
   - Player navigates between quantum stability and economic survival

Why this works thematically:

Current game: "Farm in a quantum ecosystem"
  - Crops are quantum superpositions
  - Evolution is Hamiltonian physics
  - Pure natural dynamics

With 🏰: "Farm under imperial rule in a quantum ecosystem"
  - Imperium is ANOTHER qubit
  - Its influence is ANOTHER Hamiltonian coupling
  - Now you have COMPETING authorities: Nature vs Empire

This parallels real quantum systems:
  - Qubits interact with multiple environments simultaneously
  - Decoherence from multiple sources
  - Players experience "environmental noise" from both nature AND politics

Mechanically, it's elegant:
- No new systems needed (Qubit coupling already exists)
- Uses existing tribute/economy infrastructure
- Spatial gameplay emerges from Bloch sphere geometry
- Φ (azimuthal) angle finally has meaning: "imperial season"

REUSES YOUR COORDINATES:
  - θ (polar): Crop type (wheat vs mushroom)
  - φ (azimuthal): Imperial season/intensity

Could even parameterize:
   tribute_rate = base_rate * sin(sun_theta/2)
   # High summer (sun at π/2) = weak imperium
   # Dark winter (sun at 0) = strong imperium
