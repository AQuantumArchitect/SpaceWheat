# SpaceWheat Faction Classification: 32-Faction System

## The 12 Q-Bit Classification System

Each faction is classified using 12 binary dimensions:

1. **🎲 ↔ 📚** (Random vs Deterministic) - 0=Random/unpredictable, 1=Deterministic/rule-based
2. **🔧 ↔ 🔮** (Material vs Mystical) - 0=Physical/tool-based, 1=Ethereal/consciousness-based
3. **🌾 ↔ 👑** (Common vs Elite) - 0=Working class/grassroots, 1=Aristocratic/ruling class
4. **🏠 ↔ 🌌** (Local vs Cosmic) - 0=Community-focused/domestic, 1=Universal/galaxy-spanning
5. **⚡ ↔ 🕰️** (Instant vs Eternal) - 0=Immediate action/results, 1=Long-term/patient process
6. **💪 ↔ 🧠** (Physical vs Mental) - 0=Action/strength/embodiment, 1=Thought/planning/knowledge
7. **💠 ↔ 🌊** (Crystalline vs Fluid) - 0=Rigid/permanent/structured, 1=Adaptive/flowing/changing
8. **🗡️ ↔ 🎭** (Direct vs Subtle) - 0=Force/confrontation/obvious, 1=Influence/manipulation/hidden
9. **🍽️ ↔ 🎁** (Consumptive vs Providing) - 0=Extractive/depleting/taking, 1=Generative/giving/providing
10. **⬜ ↔ 🌈** (Monochrome vs Prismatic) - 0=Single-minded/uniform/focused, 1=Multi-faceted/diverse/colorful
11. **🌱 ↔ 🏗️** (Emergent vs Imposed) - 0=Bottom-up/natural arising/organic, 1=Top-down/constructed/artificial
12. **🌪️ ↔ 🎯** (Scattered vs Focused) - 0=Dispersed/multi-purpose/generalist, 1=Concentrated/specialized/targeted

## IMPORTANT: All Factions Are Mystical in Quantum Setting

**Note**: In SpaceWheat's quantum substrate setting, ALL 32 factions have bit[1]=1 (Mystical) because the entire universe operates on quantum principles. Even the most "mechanical" factions (like Rust Fleet, Obsidian Will) interact with hyperspace, quantum states, and probability amplitudes. There are no purely "classical" factions in a game about quantum wheat farming.

The Material(0) vs Mystical(1) axis represents:
- **Material(0)**: Would be purely classical, no quantum effects → NO factions have this
- **Mystical(1)**: Interacts with quantum substrate, uses special properties → ALL factions
