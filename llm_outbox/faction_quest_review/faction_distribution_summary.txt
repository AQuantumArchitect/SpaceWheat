QUEST TYPE DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

AMPLITUDE quests (12 factions):
  - All Material + Direct + Monochrome factions
  - Example: "Cultivate 🌾 to 80% probability"
  - Measures: Single emoji population (diagonal ρᵢᵢ)

COHERENCE quests (7 factions):
  - Mystical + Direct + Monochrome factions
  - Example: "Create entanglement between 🌾 and 🍄"
  - Measures: Quantum coherence (off-diagonal |ρᵢⱼ|²)

RATIO quests (11 factions):
  - ANY faction with Subtle bit (Material OR Mystical)
  - Example: "Make 🌾 probability twice 🍄 probability"
  - Measures: Population ratio ρᵢᵢ/ρⱼⱼ

MULTI quests (2 factions):
  - Prismatic bit (Symphony Smiths, Resonance Dancers)
  - Example: "Balance 🌾, 🍄, and 💨 equally"
  - Measures: Multiple populations simultaneously

UNIFORM distribution (2 factions):
  - All bits = 1 (Entropy Shepherds, Reality Midwives)
  - Get 25% of each quest type (maximum complexity)

================================================================================
KEY PATTERNS
================================================================================

SUBTLE bit is DOMINANT:
  - 11 out of 20 Mystical factions have Subtle bit
  - This creates heavy bias toward RATIO quests
  - Makes sense: mystical factions care about relationships, not absolutes

PRISMATIC bit is RARE:
  - Only 2 factions have Prismatic (Symphony Smiths, Resonance Dancers)
  - Creates scarcity of MULTI quests (good for progression!)

Material factions are mostly DIRECT:
  - 11 out of 12 Material factions → AMPLITUDE quests
  - Exception: Granary Guilds (Subtle → ratio quests for food distribution)

All ULTIMATE COSMIC ENTITIES have interesting patterns:
  - Entropy Shepherds: ALL 1s → uniform distribution
  - Void Emperors: Mostly 1s but Direct → COHERENCE
  - Reality Midwives: ALL 1s → uniform distribution

================================================================================
POTENTIAL ISSUES / QUESTIONS
================================================================================

1. Too many RATIO quests?
   - 11 factions generate ratio quests (34% of total)
   - Maybe some Subtle factions should be Direct?

2. Too few MULTI quests?
   - Only 2 factions (6% of total)
   - Could add Prismatic bit to more factions?

3. Granary Guilds anomaly:
   - Only Material faction with RATIO quests
   - Is this intentional? (food price ratios make sense!)
   - Or should they be Direct for absolute quantities?

4. Missing faction personality matches:
   - Should Syndicate of Glass be Material? (physical crystals)
   - Should Symphony Smiths be Material? (physical forging)
   - Should Iron Shepherds be Material? (knights in ships)

5. Horror Cults all have Subtle:
   - Makes thematic sense (subtle corruption)
   - But creates uniformity (all ratio quests)
   - Could some be Direct for variety?
