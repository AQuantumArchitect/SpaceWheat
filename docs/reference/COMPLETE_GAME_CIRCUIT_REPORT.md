Measurement Sequence:
  1. Bell state verification: GHZ (Horizontal) ✓
  2. Measure each qubit independently
  3. Stochastic outcomes:
     - Flour: P(state1)=25% → measured 0.75
     - Water: P(state1)=14.6% → measured 0.85
     - Fire: Special outcome → enhanced measurement

Energy Calculation:
  Input energy: (0.60 + 0.60 + 0.45) = 1.65
  Efficiency: 0.80
  Bread produced: 1.32 energy
