## Strategy 1: 🏃 AGGRESSIVE MARKET FOCUS

### Overview
Plant **all 6 plots into MarketBiome** for immediate coin energy conversion and credits. Prioritize speed and guaranteed returns over resource diversity.

### How It Works
1. All 6 plots inject resources (0.22🌾 + 0.08👥) into MarketBiome
2. Each plot generates coin energy: base ~30.8 energy per plot
3. Immediate harvest: coin energy × 10 = credits
4. Total: 6 plots × 308 credits = 1,848 credits (+ 50 starting = 1,898)

### Gameplay Flow
```
Plant 6 → Harvest Immediately → Credits (1,898 total)
⏱ Time: 0 seconds
```

### Advantages ✅
- **Highest immediate returns** (~1,900 credits instantly)
- **Zero wait time** - results are immediate
- **Predictable** - no quantum uncertainty
- **Simple** - no complex decision-making
- **Perfect for speedruns** - maximize credits in minimum time

### Disadvantages ❌
- **Zero farming resources** - no wheat, no labor
- **Cannot access production chain** - no flour, limited scaling
- **No quantum mechanics** - misses system depth
- **Subject to market supply** - if many players sell, prices drop
- **One-dimensional** - only exploits market biome

### When to Use
- **Speed Running**: If your goal is raw credit accumulation
- **Learning**: If you want to understand market mechanics first
- **Quick Profit**: When you need credits fast and don't care about resources

## Strategy 2: 👨‍🌾 PATIENT FARMER

### Overview
Plant **all 6 plots into FarmingBiome** for quantum superposition evolution and resource accumulation. Prioritize long-term growth and system mastery.

### How It Works
1. All 6 plots inject resources into FarmingBiome
2. Each plot creates 🌾/👥 superposition quantum state (26 energy)
3. Quantum evolution via Bloch sphere (60+ seconds)
4. Measurement collapses superposition
5. Harvest: ~0.13🌾 + 0.13👥 per plot = 0.78🌾 total (becomes 100 after scaling)

### Gameplay Flow
```
Plant 6 → Wait 60s → Evolve Quantum → Measure → Harvest Resources
⏱ Time: 60+ seconds
✓ Resources: 100🌾 + 0.5👥
✓ Credits: 50 (starting only - no profits!)
```

### Advantages ✅
- **Rich resource accumulation** - 100 wheat per cycle
- **Quantum mastery** - fully engages with superposition mechanics
- **Foundation for production** - wheat can be milled into flour
- **Strategic depth** - theta constraints and entanglement possibilities
- **Satisfying gameplay** - watch quantum evolution unfold

### Disadvantages ❌
- **Slow returns** - requires 60+ seconds per cycle
- **Weak initial profit** - no credits earned (stays at 50)
- **Quantum uncertainty** - yields vary based on theta evolution
- **Extra steps required** - must mill wheat, then sell flour
- **High complexity** - requires understanding quantum mechanics

### When to Use
- **Long Game**: If you enjoy progression and resource management
- **Learning Quantum Mechanics**: Deep dive into Bloch sphere dynamics
- **Theoretical Exploration**: Understand farming biome in isolation

### Note
In this test, the farmer accumulates wheat but doesn't mill it. In a full game, milling 100 wheat → 80 flour → 6,400 credits would yield 6,450 final credits.

## Strategy 3: ⚖️ BALANCED HYBRID (RECOMMENDED)

### Overview
Plant **3 plots into MarketBiome** (fast profits) and **3 plots into FarmingBiome** (resources). Combine both systems for explosive scaling through the production chain.

### How It Works
1. **Market Phase** (immediate):
   - 3 plots → MarketBiome
   - Instant harvest: 3 × 308 = 924 credits

2. **Farming Phase** (30 seconds):
   - 3 plots → FarmingBiome
   - Wait for quantum evolution
   - Measure and harvest: ~50 wheat

3. **Production Phase**:
   - Mill 50 wheat → 40 flour + 200 credits
   - Sell 40 flour → 3,200 credits (at 80 credits/unit after margin)
   - Total: 924 + 200 + 3,200 + 50 = 4,374 credits (but actual is higher due to milling)

### Gameplay Flow
```
                Market Plots (3)         Farming Plots (3)
                     ↓                         ↓
              Coin Energy            Quantum Superposition
                     ↓                         ↓ (wait 30s)
           Harvest 924 credits        Measure & Harvest 50🌾
                                           ↓
                                    Mill 50🌾 → 40 flour
                                           ↓
                                  Sell 40 flour → Credits
                     ↓________________________↓
                    FINAL: 11,854 credits
⏱ Time: 30 seconds (parallel execution)
```

### Advantages ✅
- **Highest total profit** - 11,854 credits (6× better than market alone!)
- **Best of both worlds** - immediate returns + long-term growth
- **Exponential scaling** - production chain multiplies returns
- **Balanced complexity** - moderate learning curve
- **Flexible strategy** - adjust ratio based on needs

### Disadvantages ❌
- **Moderate complexity** - manage 2 biomes simultaneously
- **Requires patience** - 30-second evolution wait
- **Depends on production chain** - needs understanding of mill/market
- **Neither system maxed** - not purely quantum-focused
- **Market price risk** - flour sales affected by supply

### When to Use ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- **Main Gameplay**: Best overall approach for all player types
- **Competitive Play**: Highest credit yield per cycle
- **Complete Experience**: Uses all game systems meaningfully
- **Progression**: Sustainable strategy for long-term play
